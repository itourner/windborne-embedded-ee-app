# WindBorne Embedded Electrical Engineer — Submission

## PCB Example
**Elegant feature:** I intentionally partitioned the design into modular blocks (power, DIO/level shifting, motor/encoder, and analog acquisition) with clear connectors and bring-up hooks (test points + jumpers). That made it easy to populate only what was needed for a given build and iterate quickly without changing the core PCB.
